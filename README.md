# CodeClause_AssignmentSite
<h1> This is just a assignment by CodeClause </h1>

<p> This website is just a somewhat clone of the main site -> https://internship.codeclause.com/ </p>
<p> I have changed a few things but most of the design is similar.</p>
<p> About the color I choose the theme color as per the main site color and it was nice.</p>

<p> Most part was easy but the problem I had was responsive code it was a bit challanging .</p>
<p> I faced a difficulty while making it responsive but I made it after a few tries.</p>
<p> And for the javascript part I didn't use that much javascript , only used for the hamburg menu.</p>
<p> I could have used gsap for smooth scrolling and scroll trigger but I was out of time so I just designed accordingly. </p>
<p> There isn't any addtional features just a few hover effects and colored icons and a bit of shape designing.</p>

<p> The main problem of my code is there is less comments than there should be so that's a minus point about my code.</p>
<p> I'm trying to write comments as much as needed but there are many missing .</p>
